# Titanstar Rune Mastery Frontend

## Instructions
To view the application and purchase talents, head to https://www.jessicasills.com/titanstar-vanillajs.
- Left click to purchase talents
- Right click to remove talents
- You can purchase a maximum of six talents

## Features

### Vanilla JS
In a loose attempt to emulate React components, I created classes to represent Talents, the Talent Track, and the Point Counter.

### localStorage
State is maintained using the browser's localStorage. In a full stack application, I would utilize APIs to get the talents and get/put the user data.

### SCSS
A custom SCSS library is used for styling. I emulated Bootstrap's naming conventions.

## Future Iterations
Here are some features I'd implement given more time:
- Tooltips for the talents when hovering over them, to describe what they do and what their prerequisite(s) are.
- Visual feedback to the user when they attempt to do an incorrect action. Right now, errors are simply being console logged.
